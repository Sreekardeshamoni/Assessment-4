## 1. Introduction

Every team owner wish to have top players only. But, its also a business and we need to "purchase!" only value for money players for maximum utilization of money. The report finds top 5 value for money players with the help of linear regression analysis performed with help of R packages(1). 

The top 5 players are:

```{r echo=FALSE}
final_players<-data.frame(POSITION=c('PG','SG','SF','PF','C',""),PLAYER=c('Ben Simmons','Devin Booker','Brandon Ingram','Julius Randle','Karl-Anthony Towns','TOTAL'),
             SALARYmillions=c(6.43,3.31,5.75,8.64,7.83,31.96))
final_players
```

### a) Description of scenario

Chicago Bulls is a Basketball team which participates in the NBA (National Basketball Association) seasons(2). General manager of Chicago Bulls has approached me, i.e. the author of this project; to find 5 best players for 5 positions, one player for each position for the next NBA season 2019-20.

### b) Background information

It is better to get some idea of the basketball game. Normally, a team has 5 players and these players are assigned to 5 positions. The basketball positions are assigned a number as under:

1. Point Guard [PG]

Main task of points guard is to score points. Besides that he should help in assists and limiting turnovers.

2. Shooting Guard [SG]

Main task of shooting guard is to score points. Besides that he should help in assists and limiting turnovers.

3. Small Forward [SF]

Main task of small forward is to score points. Besides that he should help in assists and limiting turnovers. 

4. Power Forward [PF]

Main task of power forward is to score points. Besides that he should help in rebounds and limiting turnovers.

5. Center [C]

Rebounds, Blocking and limiting turnover are the key metrics for center. 

### c) Aim of project 

The aim of this project is to find out the 5 best players, one for each position for 
Chicago Bulls for the next session 2019-20. It may be noted that we are not going to just pick the top 5 players. We need to consider the budget and need to develop a model which identifies the undervalued players. 

### d) Justification and importance 

The budget of Chicago Bulls for player contracts next season is $118 million. If this project is able to provide an accurate prediction of the 5 player who are value for money, then the Chicago Bulls will be able to get good players in reasonable amount. Besides that the recommendation and selection of the players shall be free from bias as it shall be data based. 
Linear regression shall help in finding the undervalued players. We need to find the players with the ability to score high points but getting a lower to moderate salary. Thus, at first we shall develop a model to predict the players ability to score points and thereafter compare this with players salary and select the value for money players of different positions with help of this framework.
As stated earlier that the top players are very costly, hence it makes sense to develop a metric to value players based on that metric to their relative contribution to score points. 
The confidence interval limits are positive. i.e. it is not that one limit is negative and one limit is positive. 

## 2. Reading and cleaning the raw data

### Date Description

The data set consists of 5 csv files. The data description is can be seen by clicking below link: <https://github.com/Sreekardeshamoni/Assessment-4/blob/main/Data%20Description.pdf>

### Loading tidyverse library and reading the data

The csv files are saved in data frames tibbles of readr package. 
```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
player_stat = read_csv("data/raw/2018-19_nba_player-statistics.csv")
player_salary = read_csv("data/raw/2018-19_nba_player-salaries.csv")
team_payroll = read_csv("data/raw/2019-20_nba_team-payroll.csv")
team_stat_1 = read_csv("data/raw/2018-19_nba_team-statistics_1.csv")
team_stat_2 = read_csv("data/raw/2018-19_nba_team-statistics_2.csv")
```
Now, its time to have a look at data structure.
```{r}
str(player_stat)
str(player_salary)
str(team_payroll)
str(team_stat_1)
str(team_stat_2)
```
R can manage the "illegal" variable names by surrounding the variable name by ``, however, as a best practice it makes sense to rename the variables.
```{r}
player_stat <-rename(player_stat,
                    FGp = `FG%`, 
                    x3P = `3P`, 
                    x3PA = `3PA`, 
                    x3Pp = `3P%`, 
                    x2P = `2P`, 
                    x2PA = `2PA`, 
                    x2Pp = `2P%`, 
                    eFGp = `eFG%`, 
                    FTp = `FT%`)

team_stat_1 <-rename(team_stat_1, 
                           x3PAr = `3PAr`, 
                           TSp = `TS%`, 
                           eFGp = `eFG%`, 
                           TOVp = `TOV%`, 
                           ORBp = `ORB%`, 
                           FTpFGA = `FT/FGA`, 
                           DRBp = `DRB%`)

team_stat_2 <-rename(team_stat_2,
                           FGp = `FG%`, 
                           x3P = `3P`, 
                           x3PA = `3PA`, 
                           x3Pp = `3P%`, 
                           x2P = `2P`, 
                           x2PA = `2PA`, 
                           x2Pp = `2P%`,
                           FTp = `FT%`)
```

## 3. Exploratory analysis

### Checking missing values player_stat
At first need to check the missing values.
```{r}
sum(is.na(player_stat))
which(is.na(player_stat), arr.ind = TRUE)
naniar::vis_miss(player_stat)
```

There are missing values for FGp, x3Pp, x2Pp, eFGp, and FTp. These are calculated field in the raw data itself, and where the denominator and/or numerator is zero, these fields becomes NA. 
However, it is understood that these are values where field goal, 2 Pointer and 3 Pointer was not done by the player. Hence, it is a good idea to replace these values by 0%.
```{r}
player_stat <- replace_na(player_stat, list(FGp = 0,x3Pp = 0,x2Pp = 0, eFGp = 0, FTp = 0))
sum(is.na(player_stat))
naniar::vis_miss(player_stat)
```

If we check the player_name variable, we find that a total of 86 players have played for more than 1 team in the season. 
mydf1 = df1 %>% group_by(player_name) %>% summarise(num_of_teams =n()) %>% filter(num_of_teams>1)

### Checking missing values player_salary
```{r}
sum(is.na(player_salary))
which(is.na(player_salary), arr.ind = TRUE)
naniar::vis_miss(player_salary)
```

### Checking missing values team_payroll
```{r}
sum(is.na(team_payroll))
which(is.na(team_payroll), arr.ind = TRUE)
naniar::vis_miss(team_payroll)
```

### Checking missing values team_stat_1
```{r}
sum(is.na(team_stat_1))
which(is.na(team_stat_1), arr.ind = TRUE)
naniar::vis_miss(team_stat_1)
```

team_stat_1 has last 3 columns ...23, ...24, ...25 and these appears to be bogus columns and there is need to deleted these columns. 
The tidy team_stat_1 shall be as under:
```{r}
team_stat_1 = select(team_stat_1,-c(...23:...25))
team_stat_1
```

Now, the bogus columns are gone. 
This can be crossed checked:
```{r}
naniar::vis_miss(team_stat_1)
```


### Checking missing values team_stat_2
```{r}
sum(is.na(team_stat_2))
which(is.na(team_stat_2), arr.ind = TRUE)
naniar::vis_miss(team_stat_2)
```

We can combine team_stat_1 and team_stat_2.
```{r}
team_stat <- left_join(x = team_stat_1[-1], y = team_stat_2[-1], by = "Team") #don't need cols 1 of Ranks
```


### Other aspects
Interesting fact is that there are 30 teams, but in the player statistics table, there are 31 teams.We find that extra team is TOT which represents the total of all the instances matrices,where a player played from 2 or more teams in the season. We need the total of performance done by such players for the teams they were playing. This can be get with row where team name is "TOT". Thus, fur such players,we can keep only the row having "TOT" as team.
```{r}
player_stat <- player_stat %>% group_by(player_name) %>% add_tally() %>% filter(n==1 | n>1 & Tm == "TOT")
```
Earlier, the player_stat has 730 rows, however, it has 530 rows.But one more issue is remaining.We find that there are a number of players who have played at different positions. However, we need to consider only a single position for these players. The best approach is to select the position for which the player has played most of the games. Luckily, we find that the raw data file, has already done this in some way. For example..
We just need to extract the characters before -, in the Pos column. 
```{r}
player_stat <- player_stat %>% separate(col = Pos, into = "Pos")
```

Also, some of the players have played a lower number of games. In fact, there are 20 players who have played only 1 game. We need to create a sort of cutoff and minimum 10 games cutoff is a reasonable cut off. 
```{r}
player_stat <- player_stat %>% filter(G>=10)
```


There are 576 players in players salary table, however, there are only 530 unique players in the player statistics table. It means that some of the players did not played in NBA or the data for them is not available in player statistics. However, this fact is considered unimportant for the given project analysis. 
We can combine player_salary and player_stat
```{r}
player_stat <- inner_join(x = player_stat, y = player_salary, by = "player_name")
```


## 4. Data modelling and results
### Valuing Players
The main purpose of any basketball game is that the team wins that game. However, wining of games cannot alone a factor to select the players. In fact only team wins the matches and a player alone cannot have a credit to win the game and basket ball is a team game. Thus, we need find some metrics which includes several indirect measures to rate the players. 
A player alone may not win the game but it can score points. Points win the games and and after all players are recruited to  score points. 
Now, we will create a metric to value the players based upon certain factors/variables. This metric can be called exp_PTS_per_game. We shall then identify the undervalue players with the help of this metric(3). 

In order to predict the exp_PTS_per_game, we need to find some key variables for our analysis(4). There after we will perform a multiple linear regression model. 

Some of the metrics to be used are below:


TRB Total Rebounds  

AST Assists

STL Steals

BLK Blocks

TOV Turnovers

However, as number of games played by players are different, it makes sense to normalize these metrics per game. 

```{r}
normalised_team_stat <- team_stat %>% mutate(
  PTS_per_game = PTS / G,
  TRB_per_game = TRB / G,
  AST_per_game = AST / G,
  STL_per_game = STL / G,
  BLK_per_game = BLK / G,
  TOV_per_game = TOV / G)
```

Checking that PTS_per_game is correlated with Wins or not...
```{r}
ggplot(normalised_team_stat, aes(x = PTS_per_game, y = W))+ 
geom_point(alpha = 0.5, colour = "red")+ 
geom_smooth(method = "lm")

#checking correlation between Win and Points_per_game
cor(x = normalised_team_stat$PTS_per_game, y = normalised_team_stat$W, method = "pearson")
```

Thus, we can see that Points_per_game has a positive correlation with Win. 

Before developing a multiple regression model for PTS_per_game we should see confirm that dependent variable PTS_per_game and independent variables are related. 

```{r}
ggplot(normalised_team_stat, aes(x = TRB_per_game, y = PTS_per_game))+ 
geom_point(alpha = 0.5, colour = "red") + 
geom_smooth(method = "lm")
ggplot(normalised_team_stat, aes(x = AST_per_game, y = PTS_per_game))+
geom_point(alpha = 0.5, colour = "red") + 
geom_smooth(method = "lm")
ggplot(normalised_team_stat, aes(x = STL_per_game, y = PTS_per_game))+
geom_point(alpha = 0.5, colour = "red") + 
geom_smooth(method = "lm")
ggplot(normalised_team_stat, aes(x = BLK_per_game, y = PTS_per_game))+
geom_point(alpha = 0.5, colour = "red") + 
geom_smooth(method = "lm")
ggplot(normalised_team_stat, aes(x = TOV_per_game, y = PTS_per_game))+
geom_point(alpha = 0.5, colour = "red") + 
geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

We can see that variables has a linear relations. 
Now, we create a multiple regression model for exp_PTS_per_game. 

```{r}
fit <- lm(PTS_per_game ~
  TRB_per_game  + AST_per_game  + STL_per_game  + BLK_per_game  + TOV_per_game, data = normalised_team_stat)
tidy(fit, conf.int = TRUE)
```

**Our Model says:**

**$expPTSpergame = RBpergame  + ASTpergame  + STLpergame  + BLKpergame  + TOVpergame$**

### Checking Multiple Linear Regression Assumptions 

**1. The dependent variable should be continuous.**

Yes, The Points_per_game is a continuous variable. 

**2. The independent variables should be continuous**

Yes, Each of the independent variables is continuous. 

**3. Independence of observations**

```{r}
car::durbinWatsonTest(fit)
```

The DW statistics value of 2 indicates that there is no correlation at all. We can see that in our model the value is almost 2. This indicates there is almost no correlation at all among the residuals and that we have independence of observations. 

**4. Linearity**

The dependent variable should have a linear relationship with each independent variable. 

```{r}
car::avPlots(fit)
```

We can see a linear relationship, Though it is weak in case of BLK-per_game. 

**5. Outliers**

```{r}
#Check the data for outliers.
std_res <- rstandard(fit)
points <- 1:length(std_res)
ggplot(data = NULL, aes(x = points, y = std_res)) +
geom_point(colour = "black") +
ylim(c(-4, 4)) +
geom_hline(yintercept = c(-3, 3), colour = "black", linetype = "dashed")+
theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'red'))
```
There are some outliers, but most of the points are within 3 standard deviation. 

**6. Homoscedasticity**

```{r}
res<- residuals(fit)
fitted <- fit %>%  predict()
ggplot(normalised_team_stat, aes(x = fitted, y = res))+
geom_point(colour = "black")+
geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = "black", linetype = "dashed")+
theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'red'))+
geom_smooth(se = FALSE, colour = "white")
```


Yes, the data shows homoscedasticity evident from randomisation visible.

**7. Normality**

```{r}
ggplot(data =NULL, aes(x= res))+
geom_histogram( colour = "red", fill = "black", binwidth = 1.5)+
theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'red'))
```

Yes, the data points appear normally distributed. 

**8. Multicollinearity**

```{r}
pairs(formula = ~ TRB_per_game  + AST_per_game  + STL_per_game  + BLK_per_game  + TOV_per_game, data = normalised_team_stat)
car::vif(fit)
sqrt(car::vif(fit))
```

The model does not show any multicollinearity and this is the required aspect. 

### Model Testing & Player Metric

**Applying the model**

```{r}
normalised_team_stat <- mutate(normalised_team_stat,exp_PTS_per_game=predict(fit,newdata=normalised_team_stat))
```

graph
```{r}
ggplot(normalised_team_stat, aes(exp_PTS_per_game, PTS_per_game, label = Team)) +
geom_point(colour = "dodgerblue") +
geom_text(nudge_x = 0.1, cex = 3) +
geom_abline(linetype = "dashed", colour = "magenta")
```

graph 
```{r}
ggplot(normalised_team_stat, aes(x = W, y = exp_PTS_per_game, label = Team)) +
geom_point(colour = "dodgerblue") +
geom_text(nudge_x = 2, cex = 3)
```

**Player Metric**

At first we normalize the player_stat
```{r}
normalised_player_stat <- player_stat %>% mutate(
  PTS_per_game = PTS / G,
  TRB_per_game = TRB / G,
  AST_per_game = AST / G,
  STL_per_game = STL / G,
  BLK_per_game = BLK / G,
  TOV_per_game = TOV / G)
str(normalised_player_stat)
```

Next, step is to calculate player specific expected points. 

```{r}
fit <- lm(PTS_per_game ~
  TRB_per_game  + AST_per_game  + STL_per_game  + BLK_per_game  + TOV_per_game, data = normalised_player_stat)
tidy(fit, conf.int = TRUE)

normalised_player_stat <- normalised_player_stat%>% ungroup() %>% mutate(exp_PTS = predict(fit,newdata = normalised_player_stat))
```

histogram

```{r}
normalised_player_stat %>%
ggplot(aes(x = exp_PTS)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, colour = "black", fill = "dodgerblue")
```

### Lets save the processed data

```{r}
write_csv(x = final_players, path = "data/processed/finalplayers.csv")
write_csv(x = normalised_player_stat, path = "data/processed/playersstat.csv")
write_csv(x = normalised_team_stat, path = "data/processed/teamstat.csv")

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
final_players<-data.frame(POSITION=c('PG','SG','SF','PF','C',""),PLAYER=c('Ben Simmons','Devin Booker','Brandon Ingram','Julius Randle','Karl-Anthony Towns','TOTAL'),
             SALARYmillions=c(6.43,3.31,5.75,8.64,7.83,31.96))
final_players
```

We are able to find top 5 value for money players in just 26.19 millions. We are left with ample money to make remaining team.
